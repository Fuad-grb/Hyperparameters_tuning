# Time Series Analysis with Hyperparameter Tuning

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the process of analyzing time-series data with a focus on hyperparameter tuning to improve the performance of our predictive models.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is related to economic data over a period from 2005 to 2012. It includes various features, one of which is a time series that we aim to analyze and forecast.

## Features of the Project
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Creation of lag features for time series analysis
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Model evaluation and selection

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python 3.8+
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning and model tuning
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive development

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone this repository and install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
